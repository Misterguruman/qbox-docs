## Features

- **Multiple Sound Options**: There are 13 unique audio items to choose from. Divided into 7 pistol; 2 LMG; 2 SMG and 1 rifle sound.
- **Server-Sided Streaming**: All audio is streamed directly from the server, so no client-side downloads are required, ensuring every player hears the same high-quality sounds.
- **Seamless Installation**: Straightforward setup with clear instructions, making it easy to integrate on any FiveM server.
- **Optimized**: This uses the native audio engine from GTA 5. So no fake 3D audio from resources like xsound or interact-sound.
- **Fully Customizable**: Easily adjust and swap out weapon sounds per weapon. All the original XML files are included so you can change or add as many sounds as you want!
- **Free Updates**: Whenever I add more sounds I won't make a new package. All new sounds will be included in the same package. So you can get grandfathered without having to pay extra when the price increases!
